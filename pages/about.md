# The Man

My name is Daniel Huckstep, and I'm a software problem solver in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. I enjoy all kinds of programming, even assembly (sometimes).

* <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/">University of Alberta</a> graduate (Software Engineering, 2009)
* [APEGA](http://www.apegga.org/) [Engineer-in-Training](http://www.apegga.org/applicants/Engineers/mit.html)
* Blogger (technical and other)
* Gamer (PC, Xbox, DS)
* Mountain Biker
* Musician (Guitar)
* [Rocker of dreadlocks](/2010/03/18/where-my-programming-power-comes-from) (since 2003)
* Lord of the jungle (now just some finches and a ferret)
* Movie critic

I enjoy good food, better wine, accurate watches, quality cigars, and [badass pipes](http://www.lorenzettipipe.com/). I work hard and play hard. I get the job done, and get it done right, the first time. I speak my mind and listen when others speak theirs.

I work for [Yardstick](http://www.getyardstick.com/).

# The Legend

My (probably out of date) resume can be seen over at [stackoverflow careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/darkhelmetlive). I'm also on [GitHub](http://github.com/darkhelmet).

# The Site

I designed the theme for, and built this blog from scratch, multiple times, on a MacBook Pro. There was no app for that. [Check out the code](https://github.com/darkhelmet/dashvee). It runs on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/).
