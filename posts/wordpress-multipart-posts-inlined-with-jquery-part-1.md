This is the first of a multipart post. I'll be the first to admit, after
you read this, and part 2, ignoring the context and concentrating on the
actually content, you'd wonder why, but it makes sense when it's all
together.

So I've seen many multipart posts out there, *do this today, tomorrow do
this*, and every time, in order to view them all together, you, um,
can't. You have to have multiple tabs open and read one, then read the
next, flipping back and forth to refer back and it gets annoying. Why
can't they all be on one page? Well they can, with jQuery.

I wrote the theme for this blog, so I have things laid out the way I
want them, but it's also designed so that I can grab parts of it and
play with it. For example, there is a post sidebar and post content
block (okay it could've been a bit better, all that in one div, which I
could probably still do, but that's a thought for later). So if I have a
two part post, like this one, why can't I when I'm on the page for part
2, give a link to part 1, but have it magically grab the first page, and
stick it into the DOM? Oh wait I totally can!

Stay tuned to see how!
