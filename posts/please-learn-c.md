A lot of CPU cycles were spent dealing with blog posts surrounding the
whole [iPhone SDK
change](/2010/04/12/obligatory-sdk-iphone-eula-change-post). One by [Zed
Shaw](http://twitter.com/zedshaw) was interesting because it [addressed
a different part of the
problem](http://oppugn.us/posts/1270855147.html).

The point he makes is that there are people who claim to be coders out
there when all they do is write ruby code. Ruby, python, C#, perl, or
whatever are all good and fun. They are useful, powerful languages, each
with their strong and weak points.

The problem comes when people come out of high school, pick up ruby and
after a few years think they're hot shit because they built a framework
more than 10 people like. Good for you. Go debug a real programming
problem would you please?

I really try not to be biased, but of course I am. The first language I
learned was C (okay really it was C**, but it was super basic C using
the C** iostream stuff). We learned about pointers, memory, and all that
good stuff.

Throughout the rest of my school career (including work terms) I covered
(in one form or another) Java, perl, ruby, C++ (Borland and Visual
varieties), VBScript, HTML/CSS (if you want to count that), SQL,
Javascript, shell scripting, MATLAB, C#, and assembly. I might have
missed a couple but you get the idea.

I can write this blog in ruby, and I can understand what the VM is doing
by reading its code.[^1] I can understand what Joe and Aman are talking
about on [Time to Bleed](http://timetobleed.com/).

By learning (or preferably starting with) C, you *understand*. It makes
you look at what you're writing differently. It helps you understand the
implications of things you are doing, and it makes you appreciate all
the nice things a language like ruby does for you. By understanding C,
you hopefully have a better understanding of programming and the stack
(source code down to the device), and could therefore produce a better
functioning application.

By forcing developers to learn a language that doesn't hold your hand,
the capable developers will continue to produce quality applications.
The determined developers will want to build applications, so they'll
learn the language, benefitting themselves by learning valuable
programming skills, and benefitting everybody else by increasing the
number of smart, capable developers in the world.[^2]

Please go learn C if you haven't. You'll thank me later.

[^1]: I had a bug in my blog before I switched to 1.9 where the entire
    VM would segfault. After some reading (code and bug reports) and
    some valgrind and gdb work, the problem was uncovered as being a bug
    in the VM itself.

[^2]: Not to say they weren't capable or smart in their field before,
    but if I had to choose one of two people to hire for a ruby job, and
    one of them knows C, with all else being equal, I'd choose the
    developer who understands C.
