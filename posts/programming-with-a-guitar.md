The Devexpress folks apparently have a little competition once in a
while to show that their software kicks ass. The last one (as stated in
the video) was a guy with a keyboard and no Devexpress vs the guy with
chopsticks and a keyboard, but using Devexpress. Cool!

Now they step it up and they have a Guitar Hero controller to write
code. Badass!
