So I signed up at [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/) a while ago, but never
really did anything with it. I also found [Yahoo
Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/) a while ago, and put it on my [Todo
List](http://getontracks.org/) to look at, but that was about it. I
don't know why I didn't think to look at it to do this.

Anyway. Pipes lets you manipulate pretty much anything, RSS feeds being
one of them. You can feed things around, or *pipe* them, and alter
contents, do whatever.

After a little Google work, I found
[this](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=shXLBQcr3hGE3N6kBBNMsA)
pipe that converted a users Twitter RSS feed to something
[twitterfeed](http://twitterfeed.com/) can use. The Twitter RSS feed
items are normally prefixed by the username, so for twitterfeed to use
it, it really needs that stripped out, and the pipe does it. Check it
out by just popping in your Twitter username and hitting "Run Pipe".

So now I use twitterfeed to push my Twitter stuff to identi.ca. Win.
