<p>I signed up for <a href="http://gdgt.com/">gdgt</a> despite the fact that I <a href="http://twitter.com/darkhelmetlive/status/2475471224">whined</a> about it not supporting <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID.</a> <a href="http://user.gdgt.com/darkhelmet/">Here I am</a>. Wee.</p>
<p>The first thing I tried to do when I got there was add a gadget to my have list. Makes sense right? That&#8217;s what you do. So I find the Dell 6400, and&#8230;there&#8217;s no &#8216;Have it!&#8217; button. Hmm&#8230;well maybe if I&#8230;oh. There&#8217;s an &#8216;add to list&#8217; button.</p>
<p><figure><a href="http://cdn.verboselogging.com/transloadit/original/8a/1aa8f230946ada9f8a851bb361a2ab/gdgt-bar.png"><img src="http://cdn.verboselogging.com/transloadit/medium/5f/d5e7c4e00bd1baea1faaba66ff9539/gdgt-bar.png" class=" medium" alt="" /></a></figure></p>
<p>Okay, that makes sense, since they have 3 lists: have, want, had.</p>
<p>So I click that, and now I have to select a list, and then click another add button to add the gadget to my list. Three clicks. We live in a world of single clicks. I can follow somebody on Twitter with a single click, I can order <span class="caps">DVD</span> box sets from Amazon with a single click, and on various sites (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> for example), practically everything is single click (voting is a popular one).</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t I have single click goodness? Why can&#8217;t I have 3 buttons? The space is there:</p>
<p><figure><a href="http://cdn.verboselogging.com/transloadit/original/5a/fdff7276350f0847932990fd6cf24d/gdgt-bar-modified.png"><img src="http://cdn.verboselogging.com/transloadit/medium/08/aa2b9e1fa9a61c406338c97c6e270f/gdgt-bar-modified.png" class=" medium" alt="" /></a></figure></p>
<p>So I present my frustrations to <a href="http://twitter.com/gdgt">@gdgt</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/darkhelmetlive/status/3278779962">here</a></p>
<p>Their <a href="http://twitter.com/gdgt/status/3279208480">response.</a> I <a href="http://twitter.com/darkhelmetlive/status/3279270108">mention about the space available</a> and they respond with <a href="http://twitter.com/gdgt/status/3279311145">this</a></p>
<p>Cool. I&#8217;ll go with that. If they have something for that particular space, and it&#8217;s new and fancy and has more blinking lights and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinner_(wheel)">spinners</a> then we&#8217;ll just have to see what they come out with. I&#8217;m at least glad that somebody was on the ball on Twitter and responding to me right away though, since I feel my frustration is valid, and has a good solution. I even <a href="http://twitter.com/darkhelmetlive/status/3279393612">suggested a cleaner but still better way</a> to do it, so maybe gdgt users can look forward to 1 less click.</p>
<p>I still feel it should only take 1 click. What do you think?</p>
