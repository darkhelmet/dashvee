Wow, *that* was a big one.

Late Wednesday night I finished the `crypto` chapter in [Go, The Standard Library](http://thestandardlibrary.com/go.html), and it's a doozy. It pushes the size of the book up to 100 pages.

**Think about that.** It's only 7 out of 40 chapters complete. It's kind of freaking me out.

There's a mailing list, [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/TheStdLib), and a [feedback form](http://thestandardlibrary.com/feedback.html), so head over to [The Standard Library](http://thestandardlibrary.com/) for all things related to that.

You can buy the book for only **$39**, and please do, because that's going to go up when the book is done. Get it while it's hot!
