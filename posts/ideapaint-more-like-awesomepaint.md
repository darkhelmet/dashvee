Are you kidding me? One coat of this stuff and I can turn a wall into a
whiteboard? Not only a whiteboard, but one of the highest performing

they aren't even kidding.

When I get an actual house that I care about and can have my own little
room with my computers and whatnot, this is what's going on the wall.
