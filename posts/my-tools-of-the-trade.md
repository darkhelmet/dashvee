Well I figured since [everybody](http://www.viget.com/extend/my-tools-of-the-trade/) [else](http://afreshcup.com/2009/10/11/my-tools-of-the-trade-2009/) is doing it, why not hop on the bandwagon.

These are my tools of the trade:

## Hardware

-   **2009 Apple MacBook Pro 13" running OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.** I got
    this not too long ago, and it completed my operating system trilogy.
-   **Dell Inspiron 6400 running Ubuntu 9.04.** My lifeblood in
    university and still a solid laptop.
-   **Custom Intel Core 2 Quad desktop w/ 8 GB DDR2 RAM and EVGA nVIDIA
    295 GTX video card running Windows 7 RC.** My gaming machine, but
    also for Windows related development.
-   **[Das Keyboards](http://www.daskeyboard.com/)** - There is no better
    keyboard.

## Software

The software bits I use are pretty straightforward

-   **[TextMate.](http://macromates.com/)** Great editor.
-   **[Emacs.](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)** Another great editor.
-   **[Git.](http://git-scm.com/)** Best. SCM. Ever.
-   **Safari.** Fast and integrated.
-   **Firefox.** Letting me down lately, but still a solid development
    platform.
-   **Chrome.** Best. Browser. Ever.
-   **[LaunchBar.](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html)** I
    removed everything from and hid the dock. I much prefer to be able
    to use the keyboard to start things that searching through menus and
    what not.
-   **Visutal Studio 2008.** For those .NET Windows things.
-   **Eclipse.** For Java stuff.
-   **The gnu toolchain.** For \*NIX C hacking.
-   **[Balsamiq.](http://www.balsamiq.com/)** For when I have to do
    mockups.
-   **DropBox.** When I was in university, I would finish an
    assignment and print it out to hand it in (the ones I had to hand in
    a hardcopy for anyway). I would also put it in my DropBox, so that
    if I forgot to grab the assignment from the printer for whatever
    reason, it would be in my DropBox without me thinking and I could
    print it at school. Awesome software.
-   **[Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/)** For transferring files
    in a GUI. Great for Amazon S3 stuff.
-   **[Pixlr](http://www.pixlr.com/)** Online graphics editing with
    layer support? Sign me up!

## Other things

-   **[Heroku.](https://heroku.com/)** Best. Ruby Hosting. Ever.
-   **Google Apps.** Who really wants to deal with email and crap?
    Just Let Google Do It.&trade;
