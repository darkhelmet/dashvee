[Adam Wiggins](http://adam.blog.heroku.com/) hooked me up with the
[Heroku](http://heroku.com) stuff (and by hooked up, I mean I emailed
Heroku support and he enabled the services for me), and so I moved my
professional online presence to be hosted on
[Heroku](http://heroku.com). The URL is the same as before
([http://www.darkhax.com](http://www.darkhax.com)), but now it should be
just a bit snappier, and easier for me to deploy to.

If you haven't at least checked out [Heroku](http://heroku.com) by
visiting the site, do so now.
