I should probably actually announce surl…

Anyway. I did some reading and hacked up a little plugin to make Twitter
Tools use my URL shortener, [surl](http://s.darkhax.com)

Hopefully it works.

It's kind of unfortunate, since I have to post to test, and I really
don't want all my test posts going out to Twitter, and yet they have to…

EDIT: Yay it works. Win!

And here's the code:

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://gist.github.com/177761.js?file=surl.php"></script>
