<p>Are you excited for <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf</a>? I am! It&#8217;s my first time, and it&#8217;s made possible by my awesome employer, <a href="http://getyardstick.com/">Yardstick</a>. Thanks Yardstick!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited for the talks, though there are some time slots where it&#8217;s going to be tough to pick which talk to go to! Luckily, <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/">Confreaks</a> records everything so I can always watch it later! Thanks Confreaks!</p>
<h2>See the pattern?</h2>
<p>Two paragraphs, two thank yous.</p>
<p><strong>But I want more.</strong></p>

<h2>I want to thank you</h2>
<p>I want to meet you at RubyConf and thank you for what you&#8217;ve done in the community. However small or large that contribution is, as long as it&#8217;s positive. If you&#8217;re out trolling the python mailing lists, well that&#8217;s not fun. <a href="http://hugfriday.com/">Be positive!</a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-09-22-resque--let-s-do-this">Rescuing Resque</a> I want to thank you. If you&#8217;re <a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/2011/12/05/profiling-rails-startup-with-dtrace.html">adding DTrace probes to ruby</a> I want to thank you. If you&#8217;re putting out <a href="http://railscasts.com/">screencasts on rails</a> and <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/">other topics</a> I want to thank you.</p>
<h2>Get the picture?</h2>
<p>I want to talk to you for a few minutes, take a picture, record or write some notes in Evernote and pull everything together in a nice big blog post after the conference. You&#8217;re doing awesome stuff, and I want to recognize that.</p>
<p>I know everybody&#8217;s busy, some of you are giving talks, but there still should be lots of time to accomplish this, so please find me if I&#8217;m distracted or haven&#8217;t found you yet. I&#8217;ll be the guy with the beard and dreads. I highly doubt there are going to be other folks with dreads (though if there are, I want to meet you too).</p>
<p>Are you excited for RubyConf? I am.</p>
