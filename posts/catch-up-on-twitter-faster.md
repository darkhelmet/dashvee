So you missed Twitter for a day? Have a long list of updates along the
lines of "OMG this ice cream is fantastic!" to sort through? Fear no
more, for I have the solution.

Well. If you're using Chrome.

I made a little Chrome extension that filters out tweets that have no
actual links in them. Actual links are 'web' links, not links to user
profiles or hashtags. Tweets are interesting and all, and if you are
keeping up with them, a few about random things are fine.

If I'm sifting through 500 updates for the good stuff, and it doesn't
have a link in it, I probably don't care.

If you use Chrome (and frankly you should be), and fall behind on your
updates, but you still want to check out interesting looking links, [go grab my extension](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/poamgdllmljoaajemjegicggdfcmiidl)

Please rate, and give feedback, and submit any bugs on [the Github
page.](http://github.com/darkhelmet/twitter-catch-up/issues)

If you don't want my fancy icon in your browser bar, feel free to make
me a new icon :)
