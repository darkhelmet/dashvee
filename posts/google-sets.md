Have you check out Google Sets? It's great.

I really don't know how long it's been around, but it's pretty slick.

If you were looking for server names, like in
[this](http://serverfault.com/questions/45734/the-coolest-server-names)
serverfault question, you'll realize the power of [Google
Sets.](http://labs.google.com/sets)

Go there, and try out a few things, like characters from Star Wars.
Enter in Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. Oh look, the rest of the cast, and
even some obscure ones!

So the next time you need a set of things, like for a new bunch of
servers, or if you are just trying to remember something, try [Google
Sets.](http://labs.google.com/sets)
