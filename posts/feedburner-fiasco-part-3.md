Well I found the proper ping URL,
[http://ping.feedburner.google.com/](http://ping.feedburner.google.com/),
and it looks like everything is supposedly working as advertised. No
doubt I'll be keeping an eye on things for the next little whileâ€¦

Google Reader also seems to be a bit slow too.

EDIT: Nope. 37 minutes after publishing even with the ping and
Feedburner doesn't have it yet. Changing plugins for giggles.
