I found this slick little app a few years ago, and it looks like it's
still around. Count your VC# and VC*+ lines, and it differentiates
between code lines, blank lines, designer lines, etc, which is nice. The
downside: it's really only useful for VC# and VC*+ projects, which is
alright if that's all you are working with. Check it out.

.NET](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/LineCountUtility.asp)

PS. You'll note that I didn't mention it worked on VB stuff. Well that's
because VB isn't a real programming language :P
