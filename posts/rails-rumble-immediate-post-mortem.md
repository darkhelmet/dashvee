It's 10 minutes past 6 on Sunday evening, and [we](http://gemrage.com/)
just wrapped up our Rails Rumble 2010 project.

Check it out at [http://gemrage.com/](http://gemrage.com/). Check out
our team
[here](http://railsrumble.com/teams/proc-block-and-two-smoking-lambdas)
too.

This. Shit. Was. Real.

We had a rough start with lack of internet for 3 hours, had a few
depressing times thinking we'd never finish, but we rocked our socks off
with Windows and Internet Explorer, MacBooks, Twitter and Campfire, and
produced a pretty cool application.

Please go check out [Gemrage](http://gemrage.com/) and start scanning
your stuff.

You can do a system scan of installed gems, and project scans to see
what gems your projects use, and if they need updates. You can send your
friend a link to the project and share your gem list.

Check it out, and when the public voting opens up, go vote for us!
