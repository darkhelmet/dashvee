I discovered [TurnKey Linux](http://www.turnkeylinux.org/) while I was
running around on the web, and found it quite interesting.

From the site:

The appliances are based on Ubuntu 8.04.2 which is an LTS release, so
updates are supported until sometime in 2011. They even provide a base
setup of either plain JeOS or the the basic stack.

Looks pretty slick, and once I get my new server going (once I get a new
computer that is) with the dual core and 4GB of RAM, I'll probably play
with some of these.
