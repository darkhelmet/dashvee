[tmm1](http://twitter.com/tmm1) and [joedamato](http://twitter.com/joedamato)
put up a good slide show on slideshare about ruby threading issues, and
their fixes. These things have been around for a while, but now they are
here in slideshow form. Definitely check them out, even if you don't
program ruby, as there are some interesting profiling/debugging
shenanigans shown, among other things.
