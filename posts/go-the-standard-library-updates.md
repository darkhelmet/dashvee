Since I [posted about the
starting](/2012/04/04/go-the-standard-library-available) at the
beginning of April, naturally I've made some progress.

I haven't been posting updates here because there's the mailing list and
Twitter for that, but I've got five chapters out so it's time for a blog
update.

I'm going through the packages alphabetically so `archive`, `bufio`,
`builtin`, `bytes`, and `compress` are ready to go.

Head over to
[http://thestandardlibrary.com/go.html](http://thestandardlibrary.com/go.html)
to subscribe to the mailing list and to pick up the book. It's only
$29, but that's going to go up when the book is done.
