Indeed. What do we do? Well I was curious.

WTF you might say. "You're a programmer! Shouldn't you know what you
do?" Well yes, I know what I do. What I mean is what do programmers do
while programming ***besides programming.*** I myself [write the
codes](http://github.com/darkhelmet) (duh) and hang out on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/darkhelmetlive) and listen to podcasts,
watch movies, listen to music, and sometimes I just concentrate so hard
I forget to eat. I was curious to see what everybody else did while
hacking; [twtpoll](http://twtpoll.com/) to the rescue!

So I made a poll, and of course nobody read it, because nobody in the
software community follows me (okay that's a lie,
[@defunkt](http://twitter.com/defunkt) follows me, as well as a couple
friends), so I nicely asked [Scott
Hanselman](http://twitter.com/shanselman) and that fixed the problem.
Overnight there were just over 500 responses. Alright, now we're in
business! On to the results!

Pretty straightforward, and I think it the fact that half list listening
to music makes perfect sense.

The extra stuff I pulled out and revised a bit for easier reading:

-   Listen to talk radio/audio books
-   Google
-   Reddit/Slashdot
-   Watch TV
-   Answer TwtPolls
-   Spend time with the kid(s)
-   Spend time with the pet(s)
-   Prepare food
-   Eat
-   Wash dishes
-   Do the laundry
-   Answer coworkers questions
-   Chat/IRC
-   Play video games
-   Random web browsing
-   Download and try new software
-   Respond to fellow programmers
-   Check stackoverflow/serverfault/superuser
-   Get interrupted by other people
-   Drink coffee/alcohol/coke
-   More programmingâ€¦
-   Read RSS feeds
-   Read blogs
-   Read books
-   Answer email
-   [Compile](http://xkcd.com/303/)
-   Drum along the desk
-   Dodge co-worker distractions
-   Online browser games (chess)
-   Try to ignore everything else

The really interesting ones were:

-   Have sex
-   Work on plans to sing a new song to Steve Ballmer

So that's it. That's what programmers do.
