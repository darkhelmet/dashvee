This might seem trivial, but once you start an upload of a video to
YouTube from your iPhone, I couldn't find a way to cancel it.

Well no more are terrible drunken videos going to get uploaded! Oh wait,
yes they will. Nevermind.

Anyway. The simple way? Just set your phone to airplane mode. It turns
off the radio, so if you are uploading on your cellular network, this
will cause the upload to fail. If you are on Wifi, I would also assume
that you could just turn off Wifi and it would fail. If it doesn't, just
turn off the radio by switching to airplane mode in your settings.

In Soviet Russia, YouTube uploads you!
