<p>In my <a href="/2010/11/29/2-node-js-apps-that-showed-me-the-light">previous post</a>, I talked about <a href="http://kindlebility.darkhax.com/">kindlebility</a>, my little nodejs application for sending articles to your Kindle. It was initially just built for one person, but then I was like &#8220;screw it&#8221;, and opened it up to the world.</p>
<p>I gave it a nice(ish) front page, an explanation, and a builder for the bookmarklet. I used <a href="http://github.com/madrobby/zepto">zepto</a> for the Javascript stuff, and the Google Font Directory for some nice fonts.</p>
<p><figure><a href="http://cdn.verboselogging.com/transloadit/original/69/950c0e9281cab2f300d211cada7ac0/kindlebility.png"><img src="http://cdn.verboselogging.com/transloadit/large/a3/fa9cacd6dbb9f836588fd2972fbbd7/kindlebility.png" class=" large" alt="" /></a></figure></p>
<p>All you need to do is drop either of your Kindle email addresses in the box, and you&#8217;ll get a bookmarklet link you can drag up to your bookmarks bar. From there, just hit the bookmarklet on an article you want to read on your Kindle, and <span class="caps">BOOM</span>, it&#8217;s there. You can use the <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a> to get an idea of what it will look like first if you want.</p>
<p>Check it out over at <a href="http://kindlebility.darkhax.com/">http://kindlebility.darkhax.com/</a> and check out the source on <a href="https://github.com/darkhelmet/kindlebility">Github</a></p>
