<p>You might have seen <a href="https://gist.github.com/3444793">this gist</a> make the rounds about keeping a programming journal.</p>
<p><strong>Writing things down is important.</strong> Write on paper, in a bug tracker, on your hand, whatever. Just write it down.</p>
<p>Writing things down is important for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>It helps you remember things.</strong> Your brain has a finite capacity, and if something is written down, especially in a &#8220;public&#8221; place, it probably won&#8217;t get forgotten.</li>
	<li><strong>It keeps you sane.</strong> If you just try to remember everything, I&#8217;m pretty sure your head will actually explode.<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<h2>Learn From the Pros</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Mythical-Man-Month-Engineering-ebook/dp/B000OZ0N6M">The Mythical Man Month</a>, and you should if you haven&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll see Brooks discuss the idea of the technical journal.<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>It&#8217;s similar, except more for the whole project instead of a single developer.</p>
<h2>My Preference</h2>
<p>I prefer things written down in the open. I don&#8217;t keep a personal programming journal, I just add comments to tickets. At work, action items and ideas from meetings go into the relevant ticket.</p>
<p>Thinking out loud about a ticket? <strong>You better believe that&#8217;s a comment on the ticket.</strong></p>
<p>This way, my personal musings about a particular problems are there for everybody to see. It gets it out of my head, and benefits the rest of the people on the project.</p>
<p>For other things outside of work, I use a combination of <a href="http://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>, and <a href="http://sprint.ly/">Sprint.ly</a> to keep track of ideas I have, bugs in my code I find, checklists I need to accomplish, books I&#8217;m reading or want to read, and other relevant bits of information.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s all written down.</strong></p>
<h2>New Hotness</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.moleskine.com/">Moleskine</a> makes a variety of goodies for taking notes and keeping journals. Their new offering integrates with <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> so you can take notes with a pen on paper, but then scan it directly into Evernote for a digital version. Evernote can then do handwriting recognition and <span class="caps">OCR</span> and all that fun stuff, giving you a nice <strong>searchable</strong> document stored in their cloud available on all your devices. How cool is that?</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t it make you want to write more stuff down?</p>
<p>You <strong>should</strong> write it down. You&#8217;ll feel better about it.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Head will most likely not actually explode, but then again, I&#8217;m not a medical professional.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><a href="#fnr2"><sup>2</sup></a> I don&#8217;t remember the exact term he used, but the technical lead on the project would go around and document work done by everybody in a journal. When I worked at BioWare, the technical lead on the project I was on did this.</p>
