If you haven't heard of [Balsamiq Mockups](http://www.balsamiq.com/),
get out from under your rock and go look. I'll wait.

Back? Cool, right?

One really cool part is they will give you a free copy if you ask, but
the deal is you have to blog about it. So this is me blogging about it.

I heard about Balsamiq a while ago, but it never really clung to me. I
never really had the need for it. I downloaded it and played with it for
a few minutes, and then moved on with life.

Then we started to use it at work. It's a big hit there. They love it
for making mockups of all the interfaces I have to implement. It's
great.

Balsamiq allows you to make mockups the way they should be. Devoid of
real style and color, but with the layout and workflow all sorted out.
That's what the mockup is supposed to do. If it looks all pretty, those
viewing the mockup will be preoccupied with the look, and not the
usefulness of the design.

Balsamiq mockups look hand drawn. They are raw. You see a text box, some
tabs, a cover flow. You don't see rounded corners, reflections, and
fancy icons. If you are making mockups yourself, it forces you to think
flow, and not style. If you are viewing mockups somebody else made, you
can focus on whether or not the interface is sound, and not if it looks
*pretty*, as they are two very different things.

So Balsamiq lets you make great mockups. Excellent. It's stable, runs on
everything (it's Air!), and it's small and lightweight. It's great if
you need to make mockups of any kind. I did have a few issues with it:
the top scroll pane wouldn't respond to my two-finger scroll on my
MacBook Pro's touchpad. From a usability point of view, the organization
of library items seemed a little out of whack. Many things are in
multiple lists, so it's hard to remember where things are, because they
are in multiple places. I suppose this makes it more likely that you'll
find what you need just by fluke, but still, it kind of bothered me.

Personally, I found that I really didn't care when using it. I have no
real need to make mockups for my own little pet projects, so I was
somewhat forcing myself to use it for the purpose of this review. I was
pleased with the result, but it felt like I could've spent that time
actually coding the interface instead of mocking it up. If there was
anybody that was going to look at those mockups, it would have felt a
little more useful.

Basically it comes down to need: do you need to make mockups? If you
have to show them to other people, and then have to live past the
initial conception, then Balsamiq is for you. If you are a one-person
team just hacking away, just go straight to code and make that your
mockup. If you really need to get something on paper before writing the
code, just grab some paper and sketch it out, Balsamiq is overkill.

I give it 9 out of 10.
