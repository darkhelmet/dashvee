1.  Uninstall Firefox
2.  Install Chrome
3.  There is no step 3

I'm seriously getting sick and tired of Firefox. Chrome for Linux can't
come any faster. When even with only 5 tabs open, it eats over 600 MB,
and frequently fades out to the standard "application not responding"
state. It can't even switch tabs without lagging. If I have a video
playing in one tab, it frequently hangs when I switch tab, or open a new
tab. Pain.

Chrome is just better, and once it comes out for Linux, I probably won't
touch Firefox again, except for testing.
