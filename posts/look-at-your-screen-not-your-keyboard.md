On the recently launched [superuser](http://superuser.com/) I found
[this](http://superuser.com/questions/7580/logitech-g15-for-gaming)
little gem.

As in my comment, why are you playing a game like [Team Fortress
2](http://www.teamfortress.com/) and looking anywhere but your screen?
Why do you need to look at your keyboard at all?

I use a [Das Keyboard](http://www.daskeyboard.com/) version 1 at work
and a version 2 at home (the current version 3 is most similar to
version 2). They are both blank. They don't require any resource hogging
drivers. They don't have any flashing lights, extra dials, programmable
buttons, or scrolling LCDs. The one downside is there is are no USB
ports either, but the newest version remedies that.

Logitech makes excellent products, and I swear by their mice, but I've
never liked their keyboards, especially the high end *gaming* keyboards.
You have to install the extra piece of software to make the LCD and
extra buttons do anything useful, and really all it does is use
resources that could be put to better use.

While I encourage to each their own, I still find it interesting that
one would want to actively give themselves something else to pay
attention to while playing a game. Just keep your eyes on your screen,
and use your keyboard for typing okay?
