At the beginning of April 2013, MWRC ensued in Salt Lake City, Utah. I rolled the dice and submitted a talk, not thinking that they'd pick it. Announcements started rolling out on the twitter, and boom, there it was.

Well, the conference came and went, and I had a great time. Lots of great speakers, met lots of great people, and learned lots of great stuff.

The videos are coming out now, and mine is available. Check it out!

If videos aren't your thing, check out the slides.
