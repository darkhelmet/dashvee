I found
[this](http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2008/05/08/few-words-on-latex-fonts)
page when trying to figure out how to get LaTeX to use Helvetica. Proved
quite useful and insightful.

One of the most interesting bits was this note:

> Nevertheless, Nimbus is still far better font type than Arial.

My question is can you tell the difference and does it really matter
whether or not you get the true Helvetica, or a close-enough knock off?
