Code Project is a great resource for developers. I use it, have projects
bookmarked, read the newsletter, and got the T-shirt (okay that's a
lieâ€¦just the underwear).

This makes it even better. You can search Code Project by doing little
more than highlighting or copy/pasting code, typing in a few words, and
blamo!, there you have it. it uses Live Search for MSDN and the
intertubes, which I'm not overly keen on, but if I want to really search
my butt of, I'll get into my browser. This is still just a nice way to
quickly get at that snippet you saw on Code Project and integrate it
into your own project.
