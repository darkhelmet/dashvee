RubyConf 2012 is at an end, and what a time it was. This was my first conference, and it was all thanks to my employer [Yardstick](http://getyardstick.com/). If it wasn’t for them, I probably wouldn’t have been able to come, learn so much, and meet so many great people.

[My mission](/2012/10/27/my-rubyconf-mission-thank-all-the-people) was to thank as many people as possible, in person. Open source is somewhat of a thankless job. Lots of people using your code or what have you, and never receiving thanks for it.

While I didn’t get to meet and thank everybody I wanted to, I did get to quite a few of you. In no particular order…

<a href="{{.matz.original}}"><img src="{{.matz.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="Matz" /></a>

## Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto

Matz is the reason we were all there. In 1993, Matz started working on
what would become ruby. In December of 1995 it was first released. Ruby
1.8 came out in 2003.

Currently, he works full time on ruby for Heroku. Basically, he gets to do what he loves, and Heroku signs the cheques.

Domo arigato Matsumoto-san. Ruby makes many people’s lives better, and the world is a better place for having it. It was a pleasure meeting you and hearing your keynote. I hope we meet again in the future.

<a href="{{.tenderlove.original}}"><img src="{{.tenderlove.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="Aaron Patterson" /></a>

## Aaron “Tenderlove” Patterson

Aaron is a beacon of positivity in the ruby community. He’s always wearing a smile and I’m pretty sure the only reason he stops working is because [his cat](https://twitter.com/gorbypuff) is sitting on his
keyboard.

He works for AT&T on open source, similar to Matz. He works on
rails-core and ruby-core, and has an impressive array of project on
[Github](https://github.com/tenderlove). Chances are you’ve run code
he’s written.

[Follow him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tenderlove) and give him a
hug.

Thanks Aaron for all the work you do, code you write, knowledge you drop
on us on [your blog](http://tenderlovemaking.com/), and your positive
attitude. It makes the community better, and encourages us all to be
better.

<a href="{{.weirich.original}}"><img src="{{.weirich.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="Jim Weirich" /></a>

## Jim Weirich

You’ve used Jim Weirich’s code. Yes you have. You know [rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/)? Yeah, that was Jim. He also made the [builder gem](http://builder.rubyforge.org/) for doing XML generation. [flexmock](http://flexmock.rubyforge.org/) is another one of his that you might use.

He always gives great presentations at conferences (go watch the videos), and is never greedy when it comes to knowledge and source code.

These [two](https://twitter.com/darkhelmetlive/status/264761788682358785) [tweets](https://twitter.com/djspinmonkey/status/264813508301058049) pretty much cover it.

Thanks Jim for the great talk, the hug, and all the work you’ve done and
given to the ruby community. It wouldn’t be the same without you.

Thank Jim yourself on [his Twitter](https://twitter.com/jimweirich) or
on [his blog](http://onestepback.org/). See what other code he’s shared
on [his Github](https://github.com/jimweirich).

## Charles Nutter, Tom Enebo, Nick Sieger

<a href="{{.jruby.original}}"><img src="{{.jruby.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="jRuby" /></a>

Charlie (center), Tom (left) and Nick (below with Corey Haines) are a few of the [JRuby](http://jruby.org/) core developers. You know, that popular ruby implementation on the JVM with some crazy performance numbers? Yeah that one. Without these smart people on the JRuby team (and also Ola Bini who wasn’t present at RubyConf), JRuby would probably just be old abandoned project not worth your time.

Because of their hard work, JRuby is a force to reckoned with. Charles is also involved with JVM optimizations (I believe he was on two JSR committees), and puts out a lot of code to help get people up and running on JRuby.

Thanks for all the hard work Charles, Tom, Nick (and Ola!). JRuby is an awesome positive project in the ruby community, and lots of people depend on it. You guys just keep making it better.

Thank Charles on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/headius) or [his blog](http://blog.headius.com/) and get his code on [Github](https://github.com/headius).

Find Tom on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tom_enebo), [Github](https://github.com/enebo) or on [his blog](http://blog.enebo.com/).

Nick Sieger is also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nicksieger), [Github](https://github.com/nicksieger) and has [a blog](http://blog.nicksieger.com/).

Ola Bini has [Twitter](https://twitter.com/olabini), [Github](https://github.com/olabini), and [a blog](http://olabini.com/blog/).

<a href="{{.img_0396.original}}"><img src="{{.img_0396.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="Corey Haines" /></a>

## Corey Haines

Corey (right, Nick Sieger left), like Aaron, is pure positivity. I’m convinced he can’t form a frown, but Sarah Gray assured me he does frown, but it’s only at poorly designed code.

As an advocate of the “software craftsmanship” movement, he started [Code Retreat](http://coderetreat.org/). These are day long practice sessions to help software developers hone their craft with others.

He’s all about becoming better, together.

Thanks Corey. Your positivity is incredibly valuable, and the ruby community is lucky to have you. Your desire to become better and help us become better as a group is something the ruby community has and others don’t. That’s actually a little sad. Everybody community should have Corey Haines.

You can find Corey on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coreyhaines), [Github](https://github.com/coreyhaines), and [his website](http://coreyhaines.com/).

<a href="{{.coby.original}}"><img src="{{.coby.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="Coby Randquist" /></a>

## Coby Randquist

Coby isn’t pumping out rubygems or ruby-core optimizations, so what does
he do? You might not be familiar with the name, because Coby is behind
the scenes. Specifically [Confreaks](http://www.confreaks.com/).

All those videos that are online from ruby and other conferences **for
free**. Coby’s company produces those. At RubyConf he and his crew were
running around between 4 different rooms, recording and live streaming
all the talks on Justin.tv.

It took a while for me to talk to Coby and thank him, because he was
always on his game and making sure things were working. If you get the
chance, shake his hand and give him the props he deserves.

Thanks Coby for all the videos! Thank him yourself on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kobier) and [his blog](http://randquist.us/blog/).

<a href="{{.helmkamp.original}}"><img src="{{.helmkamp.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="Bryan Helmkamp" /></a>

## Bryan Helmkamp

Bryan developed the [rack-bug](https://github.com/brynary/rack-bug) gem
which gives you insight into your application when things just aren’t
working the way they’re supposed to.

More recently, he founded [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) which
does hosted software metrics for ruby applications. It’s a business so
you’ll pay for private projects, but for all your open source stuff it’s
nice and free. Head over to the
[Explore](https://codeclimate.com/explore) page to see some of those
projects and add your own.

The similarity between these two projects is that they aren’t for Bryan;
they’re for us. They help us debug our software and make it better. They
encourage better code and generally improve the ruby community. Thanks
Bryan!

Find him on [Github](https://github.com/brynary) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brynary).

<a href="{{.hunt.original}}"><img src="{{.hunt.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="Chris Hunt" /></a>

## Chris Hunt

Chris Hunt gave a great talk on Service Oriented Architecture at Square.
One of the best parts was all the links to [public Github
repositories](https://github.com/square) that Square has released.

Chris Hunt and Square are shipping like bosses, and it’s making our
community better. Things like [cane](https://github.com/square/cane) and
[fdoc](https://github.com/square/fdoc) are fantastic. Outside of the
ruby community they have Android/Java projects.

They are giving it all back. Thanks Chris, and thanks Square!

Find Chris on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chrishunt), at [his website](http://chrishunt.co/), and on [Github](https://github.com/chrishunt).

<a href="{{.loren.original}}"><img src="{{.loren.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="Loren Segal" /></a>

## Loren Segal

Write documentation for your code. Pretty please? If you don’t, Loren
Segal will find you. He’s Canadian though, so he’ll probably just ask
you nicely if you could write docs. I think your kneecaps are safe.

He’s the brains behind the [yard gem](https://github.com/lsegal/yard) for documenting your ruby code. It powers [http://rdoc.info/](http://rdoc.info/) which is where I go for all my documentation needs.

When I thanked Loren, he gave this sigh of relief. You should thank him
too, and you should probably use yard to document your ruby code. He
also gave a talk at RubyConf, so check out the video when it’s up.
Thanks Loren!

He can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lsegal),
[Github](https://github.com/lsegal), and [gnuu.org](http://gnuu.org/).

<a href="{{.perham.original}}"><img src="{{.perham.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="Mike Perham" /></a>

## Mike Perham

Mike is all about concurrency on ruby. Some of his work includes
[sidekiq](http://mperham.github.com/sidekiq/),
[girl_friday](https://github.com/mperham/girl_friday), and
[rack-fiber_pool](https://github.com/mperham/rack-fiber_pool). Sidekiq
is a job queue similar to [Resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque)
but instead of processes it uses threads. girl_friday gives you an
in-process job queue, and rack-fiber_pool runs requests in ruby fibers,
which if used properly can work quite well.

He also wrote the [dalli](https://github.com/mperham/dalli) gem, a fast
pure ruby memcached client. Give some of those gems a try. You won’t be
disappointed!

Thanks for all the code Mike! Keep on pushing concurrency to new levels.

His RubyConf talk will also be on Confreaks, but until then, find him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mperham), [Github](https://github.com/mperham), [his blog](http://www.mikeperham.com/) and buy cool gear at [The Clymb](https://www.theclymb.com/) (only US, makes me a sad panda).

<a href="{{.storimer.original}}"><img src="{{.storimer.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="Jesse Storimer" /></a>

## Jesse Storimer

Jesse is a fellow Canadian, and in recent times a budding, nay,
accomplished author. He’s written two books to bring lower level
techniques such as forking, IPC, and TCP sockets to ruby developers.

For a lot of the ruby community, the C programming language is
completely foreign. Along with it go things like fork/exec, IPC, and raw
TCP socket knowledge. Jesse brings these topics together in [two
books](http://workingwithcode.com/): Working With UNIX Processes and
Working With TCP Sockets. These are important topics and will help you
understand your development stack and write better code, even if you
never actually use the techniques in your app. They’ll definitely make
you think!

Get your fork on and level up your UNIX beard, and buy his books.
Seriously. He stepped it up a bit with the newest one as for a little
bit more money you can get an hour long screencast on building an
evented IO server.

Thanks Jesse for the great resources, and thanks for the signed copy!

He’s all up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jstorimer), [Github](https://github.com/jstorimer), and [his blog](http://jstorimer.com/). Also, he is not [Chad Kroeger]({{.kroeger.original}})

<a href="{{.scofield.original}}"><img src="{{.scofield.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="Ben Scofield" /></a>

## Ben Scofield

Ben is the man behind the curtains at RubyConf. Along with Evan Phoenix
handling MC duties and his army of volunteers, Ben makes sure RubyConf
happens, and happens without anything lighting on fire.

His [Github](https://github.com/bscofield) account isn’t as active as a
lot of rubyists, but he’s got other things on his mind. He also handles
RailsConf since it’s a [Ruby Central](http://www.rubycentral.org/)
thing.

Without Ben, RubyConf probably wouldn’t have happened, or Evan’s head
would have exploded. Running a conference isn’t something you can do on
your own, but Ben and Evan made a pretty good team. Thanks for the
conference guys! It was great!

You’ll find Ben on [his blog](http://benscofield.com/) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bscofield).

## Evan Phoenix

I mentioned Evan Phoenix just a second ago along with Ben Scofield. Evan
is a director on Ruby Central, and was instrumental in RubyConf
happening the way it did. He MC’d the event, and was always around to
make sure things were going smoothly.

On top of that, he works on [Rubinius](http://rubini.us/), that other
awesome ruby implementation with real threads and no GIL, and the [puma
webserver](http://puma.io/). These are both great projects, and give
ruby developers (along with JRuby) a truly concurrent virtual machine
ready for the next generation of applications.

If that wasn’t enough, he was ear to ear smiles the whole time I saw him
at RubyConf. Thanks for all the code Evan, and thanks for the positive
attitude.

Find Evan on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/evanphx), [Github](https://github.com/evanphx) and on [his blog](http://blog.fallingsnow.net/).

<a href="{{.ford.original}}"><img src="{{.ford.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="Brian Ford" /></a>

## Brian Ford

Brian Ford, along with Evan, works on [Rubinius](http://rubini.us/).
Rubinius stays on the leading edge of ruby thanks to the hard work Brian
puts in. You really should take a serious look at. It’s ahead of the
curve and deserves more attention than it gets. Real threads, no GIL,
and a lot of the core libraries and tools are written in ruby itself.
What’s not to love?

Other languages also target the VM, which is built with other languages
in mind. It’s not *just* a ruby VM.

Next time you see Brian, go off to your computer and install rubinius,
play with it, run your app on it, report bugs and offer patches. Then go
buy him a whiskey. After his talk, of course. He gives great talks.
Thanks Brian!

Head over to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brixen), [Github](https://github.com/brixen), and [his blog](http://brixen.io/) to thank him.

## Josh Susser

Josh gave a talk at RubyConf this year, and I probably should have gone,
but the talk on racc was too tempting. I’ll probably watch the RubyConf
video a few times and have my mind blown.

On top of talking, he’s been blogging since February of 2006, on ruby,
Rails, and a variety of other topics.

You might also recognize Josh, his voice anyway, from the [Ruby Rogues
podcast](http://rubyrogues.com/) where he is a regular with the other
Rogues. Listen to that podcast if you don’t. It’s filled with good
stuff. Thanks for all the knowledge Josh!

Follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshsusser), [his blog](http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/), or his [Github](https://github.com/joshsusser).

## Eleanor McHugh

Eleanor is true hacker. She’s like a British female _why. She does ruby
and Go, plays with virtual machines, gives talks, and can dance up a
storm.

She moderated the lightning talks at RubyConf this year as well. She’s
generally a positive force in whatever community she’s in.

I highly recommend [her videos on Confreaks](http://www.confreaks.com/presenters/208-eleanor-mchugh) and [her slides on Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/feyeleanor). Thanks for all the knowledge Eleanor!

Bug her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/feyeleanor) and [Github](https://github.com/feyeleanor).

<a href="{{.mei.original}}"><img src="{{.mei.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="Sarah Mei" /></a>

## Sarah Mei

This year at RubyConf, Sarah Mei gave the first female keynote. She
dropped the mic and the roof blew off the convention center.

When she’s not wowing audiences, she’s writing ruby for the [Diaspora
project](https://joindiaspora.com/) and organizes [Rails workshops for
women](http://workshops.railsbridge.org/). She’s improving the ruby,
Rails, and social networking communities, and getting more women into
programming.

**Like a boss.** Thanks Sarah!

Give Sarah mad props at [her blog](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sarahmei), and on [Github](https://github.com/sarahmei).

<a href="{{.gary.original}}"><img src="{{.gary.medium}}" class="fright bleft bbottom" alt="Gary Bernhardt" /></a>

## Gary Bernhardt

Gary drops knowledge like bombs with his [Destroy All
Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/) screencasts and his
talks. He gave a great one at RubyConf. Watch the video if you didn’t
get to see it. Hell, watch it even if you did.

He also likes to [troll us all](https://github.com/garybernhardt/base)
once in a while. But he educates and trolls with a little smirk and it
makes us all giggle a little bit. He brings joy, knowhow, and
entertainment in one fantastically well dressed package. Thanks Gary!

Tweet Gary on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/garybernhardt), get his code
on [Github](https://github.com/garybernhardt), and buy his screencasts
at [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/).

## Phew

It’s taken me 3 days to write this up. What’s crazy is that this list is
really only a small fraction of the people who deserve thanks. I tried
to meet as many people as I could while at my first RubyConf, and I did
a pretty good job. I didn’t get to meet and thank you all though, but
there’s always next year.

If you meet somebody on this list, thank them. If you meet somebody off
the list and they are contributing positively to whatever community they
are a part of, thank them. Give them a handshake or a hug, buy them a
drink, and thank them.

**They deserve it.**

To everybody on this list, to everybody I met at RubyConf, to everybody
I haven’t met yet, **thank you.**
