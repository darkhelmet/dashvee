I use this blog to communicate things to you that I find interesting or
useful. I also use it to remember things for myself.

It took me a minute to find this one again, so I thought I better post
it so I don't lose it again. It's a solid talk with some good
information, so check it out.

Scott Hanselman talks about social networking and other interesting
