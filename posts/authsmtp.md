Need to send email from your web app? Don't want to use Gmail because of
limits?

Okay I'm not about to break into a marketing campaign, because I just
found the website, but it looks like AuthSMTP solves the problem.

I literally just discovered this place, but you can send up to 1000
emails a month (100MB data), for $24USD a year. Not too bad.

You can send with your own from address, etc, etc, and all the things
you'd expect (at first glance anyway).

If I end up having the need to pump out lots of email, I'll definitely
give it a go.
