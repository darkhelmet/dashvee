<p>There are lots of tiny little fails out there. Here are some that I&#8217;ve found.</p>
<h2>The Digg iPhone app</h2>
<p><figure><a href="http://cdn.verboselogging.com/transloadit/original/a6/3861882085141bc6a2b281c4ab680c/digg-iphone.jpg"><img src="http://cdn.verboselogging.com/transloadit/medium/1f/fc2b55d57cbfbade65f08fd747cc9a/digg-iphone.jpg" class="fright bleft bbottom round medium" alt="" /></a></figure></p>
<p>The Digg app came out for the iPhone to much fanfare but I wasn&#8217;t originally a fan.</p>
<p>First off, you can only really use the app if you have a regular Digg account. If you have a straight Facebook account like I did, there is no way to login. <strong><span class="caps">FAIL</span></strong>. If you&#8217;re going to release an app to let your users use your product, don&#8217;t alienate some of them because they chose an easier login method.</p>
<p>Second, when you digg an item (either up or down), it blocks the UI until the network call comes back. This is fan-fucking-tastic when you are on a sketchy wireless connection and it locks up the app for 2 minutes. Sure you can hit the home button to get back to the main screen, but half of Digg is digging things, so otherwise it&#8217;s just a news aggregator. Fine, but for somebody that actually uses Digg, it&#8217;s kind of useless.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also like to point out that the last mobile app I wrote (Blackberry, university project course with another guy) properly did network and filesystem activities in the background, and didn&#8217;t block the UI, so it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s the hardest problem in programming.</p>
<h2>gdgt</h2>
<p><figure><a href="http://cdn.verboselogging.com/transloadit/original/bf/ffb5a4f2cd7138c130f8fcac143b1e/gdgt.png"><img src="http://cdn.verboselogging.com/transloadit/medium/ec/b6344f0238ac816a805256596a0664/gdgt.png" class="fleft bright bbottom round medium" alt="" /></a></figure></p>
<p>I <a href="/2009/08/13/how-many-clicks-does-it-take">talked about gdgt before</a> but I&#8217;ll bring it up here again, since it&#8217;s similar to the next point.</p>
<p>Basically, <a href="http://gdgt.com/">gdgt</a> is social networking for gadgets and the geeks that love them. One of the main functions of the website is adding stuff to 1 of 3 lists: Have it, Want it, Had it. Please keep in mind that this is one of the main, if not the main function of the website.</p>
<p>You have to click three fucking times to add anything to a list. Three! <strong><span class="caps">FAIL</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Steve Krug says it doesn&#8217;t matter how many clicks it takes to do anything as long as the clicks don&#8217;t require any thought, but I beg to differ. Three clicks to do the main function of a website is bloody ridiculous.</p>
<h2>YouTube</h2>
<p>YouTube used to have a single click to add a video to your favorite list, but no more. <strong><span class="caps">FAIL</span></strong>.</p>
<p><figure><img src="http://cdn.verboselogging.com/transloadit/medium/7e/68b35ab074f3af39ae9588f5d0e5ec/gump.jpg" class="fright bleft bbottom round medium" alt="" /></figure></p>
<p>That&#8217;s all I have to say about that.</p>
<h2>Wordpress.com and Chrome</h2>
<p>For some reason, <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> fails to work properly in my Chrome Beta for Mac. It just loads forever. It&#8217;s the only page I&#8217;ve found that fails to work properly in Chrome Beta.</p>
<p>In other browsers, it&#8217;s just slow. Damn slow. <strong><span class="caps">FAIL</span></strong>.</p>
<div class='clear'></div>
<h2>Gmail mobile view</h2>
<p><figure><a href="http://cdn.verboselogging.com/transloadit/original/e3/4a1284afd520cacb233de6a0a02537/gmail-fail.jpg"><img src="http://cdn.verboselogging.com/transloadit/medium/5b/98bc3b0f7ba1d1826d6288d356f088/gmail-fail.jpg" class="fleft bright bbottom round medium" alt="" /></a></figure></p>
<p>I love Gmail, but using it on my phone sucks. I feed all my mail through my Apps account, and I have 7 addresses that it aggregates. The problem is, there is no way to send as those addresses from the mobile interface, or from Mail on the iPhone. <strong><span class="caps">FAIL</span></strong>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no drop down to choose which address you send as like in the normal view. What&#8217;s up with that? I can sort of understand that the mail app on the iPhone won&#8217;t allow this. How does it know you can send as those?</p>
<p>The mobile view though? Really? No option? Lame.</p>
<div class='clear'></div>
<p>All in all, there&#8217;s lots of fail in the world today. What sort of fail have you seen lately? Post them in the comments.</p>
