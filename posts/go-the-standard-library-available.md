It's actually happening. **[I'm writing a
book.](http://thestandardlibrary.com/go.html)**

I saw a gap in the programming world. Most languages have an extensive
standard library and core that a lot of programmers are missing out on.
I was doing things the long way because I just didn't know the standard
library had something built in.

I'm trying to fill that gap with deep looks at the standard library of
your favorite language. My first step is called **[Go, The Standard
Library](http://thestandardlibrary.com/go.html)**, about the new
programming language from some really smart people at Google.

You can head to [thestdlib.com](http://thestandardlibrary.com/go.html)
to get **[Go, The Standard Library](http://thestdlib.com/go.html)** in
it's super beta form. I've got a first draft for the first chapter,
which you can download absolutely free. If you like what you see, and I
think you will, buy the book for only **$29** and get involved in the
writing process now! See the book as it's being written and give
valuable feedback so I can make the best book possible.

Don't forget to sign up for the [mailing
list](http://thestandardlibrary.com/) as well to keep abreast of updates
to the book and other cool Standard Library things. I'll also be writing
about related things here.
