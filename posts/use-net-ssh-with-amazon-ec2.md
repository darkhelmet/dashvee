I'm writing up some scripts to automate some
[EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) setup, and
[SSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) is required. All the
examples for [Net::SSH](http://net-ssh.rubyforge.org/) show using just a
username and password, which is all good, but the Amazon stuff requires
a key file. Here's how to do it:

    Net::SSH.start('my.amazon.hostname.amazonaws.com', 'user', :keys => '/path/to/keypair.pem') { |ssh| â€¦ }

According to the docs, the `:keys` named param takes

> an array of file names of private keys to use for publickey and
> hostbased authentication

but even when I give it a string instead of an array of strings, it
works fine.
