FeedBurner has a [new feature
out](http://adsenseforfeeds.blogspot.com/2009/12/socializing-your-feed-with-twitter.html),
since Google
[announced](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/making-urls-shorter-for-google-toolbar.html)
their URL shortener.

I originally had logic to shorten the permalinks with tr.im, then post
to Twitter, but since FeedBurner can do this now, I'm not going to do
it. I like to outsource that kind of stuff, which I'll talk about in a
later post.

Also in the news today, Github is [having some
problems](http://twitter.com/github/status/6687542565), but they'll be
back soon, so don't you worry.

All in all, this is more of a test to see how fast FeedBurner sorts this
stuff out. I'm sure it'll be fine.
