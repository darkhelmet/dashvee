Regex are always fun, and since regex expressions are first class
citizens in ruby, it makes it so much easier.

I found this [Code Golf
question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/928563/code-golf-evaluating-mathematical-expressions)
on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and threw together a quick
method to do it. I can't take all the credit, since I needed to search a
bit to figure out if I could do matching parenthesis in ruby, and found
that I could, but only in ruby 1.9, which [ruby forum
topic](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/132091) showed me. Then a
commenter on SO pointed out another optimization. I also used
[rubular](http://rubular.com/) to help me with the little regex things
to get the other regex just right.

Check out my answer

Oh yeah, and vote that thing up! It's ruby 1.9 for crying out loud! :D
