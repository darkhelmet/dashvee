Hello developers, how are you? Fantastic.

Does your code look like mine? **No.**

Could it load like mine? **Yes.**

Should you use [rack-gist](http://github.com/darkhelmet/rack-gist) to
load your [gists](http://gist.github.com/)? I don’t know…

Do you like not blocking your users while you page loads another
Javascript file?

Do you want code that looks like it could write your app for you in the
dream computer it built for you with its own `DWORDS`?

Of course you do.

#### Recursive Hasselhoff!

![]({{.recursive_hasselhoff.original}})

Into the best gisting of your life.

So developers, should your code load like `rack-gist`’d code?

You tell me…

If you’re still here, you can use `Rack::Gist` to load Github Gists
asynchronously so as to not block your users. Get all your goodness at
[http://github.com/darkhelmet/rack-gist](http://github.com/darkhelmet/rack-gist).

Can you tell I’ve been watching **way** too many internet videos lately?
