<p>Hello developers, how are you? Fantastic.</p>
<p>Does your code look like mine? <strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>Could it load like mine? <strong>Yes.</strong></p>
<p>Should you use <a href="http://github.com/darkhelmet/rack-gist">rack-gist</a> to load your <a href="http://gist.github.com/">gists</a>? I don&#8217;t know&#8230;</p>
<p>Do you like not blocking your users while you page loads another Javascript file?</p>
<p>Do you want code that looks like it could write your app for you in the dream computer it built for you with its own <code>DWORDS</code>?</p>
<p>Of course you do.</p>
<h4>Recursive Hasselhoff!</h4>

<p>Into the best gisting of your life.</p>
<p>So developers, should your code load like <code>rack-gist</code>&#8217;d code?</p>
<p>You tell me&#8230;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re still here, you can use <code>Rack::Gist</code> to load Github Gists asynchronously so as to not block your users. Get all your goodness at <a href="http://github.com/darkhelmet/rack-gist">http://github.com/darkhelmet/rack-gist</a>.</p>
